# Project: LinkedList

## What I Learn:
  - How the argument used for  a "While Loop" used. How the logic of the argment works.
  - Revisit "Class" lesson again to get the understanding of how to define it.
  - How to add "(" and ")" in a string.
  - Understanding how the LinkedList Data Structure works.

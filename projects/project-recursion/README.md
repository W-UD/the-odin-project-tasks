# Recursion Tasks

## Fibbonaci: 
  *This is a tricky tasks for me. I have to see other member project and also doing some asking to AI for me to understand how to apply the formula to my code. I already know how to get the result from "n" parameter provided, but dont know how to get each sequeance into an array. Now I understand that I have to make two array: prev and next and return their concatenation to be included to another sequence result.*

## Merge Sort
 *This is also a hard task. I have to read other members task solution to get how they did it. This task is more like Learning for someone project to understand the lesson.*
